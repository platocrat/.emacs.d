# .emacs.d
My Emacs configuration: directory and init file (i.e., `init.el`).

## TODOs
Since updating to Emacs 28.0.50:
1. Move `.emacs.d` file to `.config` to clean up your home directory.
2. Review more of the changes made in Emacs 27.1 [here](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/whats-new-in-emacs-27-1)
